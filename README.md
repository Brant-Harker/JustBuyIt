## Inspiration
We were inspired by the many interesting and weird projects on r/badUIBattles and wanted to contribute to the community ~~of trolls~~.

## What it does
- Our project helps indecisive shoppers by "helping" them commit to each and every purchase
- If shoppers spend more than 30 seconds on a product page, the item will be automatically *purchased* (indicated by a popup message for the purposes of this Hackathon)
- If shoppers wish to cancel their purchase, they must go to a purchase cancellation website and complete several puzzles in sequence
- When shoppers complete all puzzles to verify their human identity, they will finally be taken to a form where they can cancel their purchase
- When they press either of the two cancel buttons, the server will show an error message telling the user that the order cancellation failed

## How we built it
We used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and the MUI library to build the UI for the website. We used JavaScript for the chrome extension.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced several challenges whilst creating the project, including:
- Trouble scraping data for the extension
- Errors when showing content underneath the "dark mode" circle
- Problems with styling MUI components

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We're proud of having a website that we can confidently post to r/badUIBattles

## What we learned
- New CSS styles like mask and clip, and CSS animations
- MUI components
- React

## What's next for JustBuyIt
- A reddit post to the r/badUIBattles subreddit
